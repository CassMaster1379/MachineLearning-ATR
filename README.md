# MachineLearning-ATR
Automatic Target Recognition for CT-based Airport Checkpoint Screening

This machine learning project was a team collaboration of recognizing targets within CT-scanned images of luggage. The goal was to extract features from the CT-images and use supervised machine learning models to predict targets of saline, rubber, or clay. Once these targets were predicted, hold-out-testing was done to find the recall rate for each target. The best model is determined and the finding are recorded in the report. The code is written in python and uses both jupyter notebook and visual studio environments.
